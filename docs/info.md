## How it works

Chrome Chain classifies handwritten digits from 8x8, 4-bit greyscale images using a
ternary-weight neural network, and stops early — as soon as the answer is already
decided — under a distribution-free conformal guarantee.

### The network

64 inputs, 32 hidden units, 10 classes. Every weight is ternary (-1, 0, +1), so a
multiply collapses into a select-and-add: the L1 layer is a signed popcount rather than a
multiplier array. Hidden activations are 4-bit unsigned. The L2 layer consumes `P = 4`
hidden units per cycle, updating all 10 class scores each cycle, and its weights and
requantisation shifts live in small ROMs with four read ports.

### Bit-serial, plane-major

Each pixel is 4 bits, so an image is four bitplanes presented MSB-first. The L1
accumulator folds them with Horner's rule — `acc = 2*acc + plane_k` — so no plane needs a
multiplier and the hidden accumulator stays 10 bits wide. Pixels are scanned one per
cycle, and a zero-skip mode can shorten a plane to its populated pixels.

### The early exit

After each plane the partial scores pass through a two-stage comparator tree that yields
the current argmax and its margin. If that margin clears the threshold for the
checkpoint, the top FSM stops: no further plane is swapped in, and the cycles the
remaining planes would have cost are never spent. Check latency is 11 cycles.

The thresholds are not hand-tuned. They come from a distribution-free conformal
calibration, which is what lets the exit carry a stated error bound instead of a hope.

Resuming costs nothing. On "not done" the accumulators are never cleared, so plane k+1
adds to the work planes 1..k already did — the exit is *anytime*, not restart. Only
`img_start` zeroes the accumulator base.

### Configuration

A 6-byte blob (48 bits, 43 in use) is written in before the first image and holds three
10-bit thresholds, per-checkpoint arm bits, per-plane inversion, the zero-skip enable, a
weight-page select, a per-plane valid-strobe enable, and `N_cap` — the maximum number of
planes to run. By default checkpoints 2 and 3 are armed and checkpoint 1 is disarmed.
Leave `N_cap` at 4: the checkpoint controller always waits for the fourth plane
boundary. Any other value is clamped to 4 and raises the `N_cap` alarm on `DFT_SEL = 3`
(and `ERR`), so a host that meant to run fewer planes sees why the chip is still
waiting for them.

Until the blob is loaded, `START` is ignored. A chip that classified with reset-value
thresholds would be silently wrong; this makes it visibly stalled instead.

### Error reporting

Five sticky alarms — scheduling violation, scanner contract breach, torn frame, config
overrun, and out-of-range `N_cap` — are readable individually on DFT view 3. Each is the
loud version of a failure that would otherwise surface only as a bad answer, which on
returned silicon is the difference between a debug hour and a debug week.

## How to test

All control lives on the bidirectional pins. `ui_in[7:0]` is the only wide data path and
carries both config words and pixel beats — never at the same time.

**1. Reset.** Hold `rst_n` low for a few cycles. With `DFT_SEL = 0`, `uo_out` reads back
`0x20`: `LD_READY` (uo[5]) is high because the fill buffer is empty, and `BUSY`, `DONE`
and `ERR` are all low.

**2. Load the config blob.** Raise `CFG_MODE` (uio[2]) and pulse `CFG_STB` (uio[3]) once
per byte with the byte on `ui_in[7:0]`. Six bytes. The loader owns the address counter, so
the host only has to count strobes. Then set `DFT_SEL = 2` and check that `uo_out[7]`
(`blob_loaded`) has gone high, and `DFT_SEL = 3` to confirm all five alarm bits are clear.

**3. Start the image.** Pulse `START` (uio[4]) for one cycle, then leave `LD_EN` low for
one more cycle. `BUSY` (uo[6]) goes high. The order matters: `START` clears the fill
buffer, so a plane loaded before `START` is discarded, and an image buffered entirely
before `START` hangs the chip.

**4. Feed the image.** Raise `LD_EN` (uio[0]) and present the image 8 bits per cycle: 8
beats per bitplane, 4 planes, MSB plane first, one beat per cycle only while `LD_READY`
(uo[5]) is high. If the per-plane valid strobe is enabled in the blob, pulse
`LD_VSTROBE` (uio[1]) with the last beat of each plane. When the answer is ready `DONE`
(uo[4]) pulses for one cycle with the predicted class on `uo_out[3:0]` as a value from 0
to 9, and `BUSY` falls.

The pixel scanner has no abort, so after an early exit it keeps running the plane it is
on for up to 52 cycles after `BUSY` falls. `SCAN_BUSY` (`DFT_SEL = 2`, `uo_out[3]`)
reports it: poll it low, or wait 52 cycles, before the next `START`. Starting earlier
scans the next image's first plane before it is loaded and latches the scanner alarm.

**5. See where it exited.** With `DFT_SEL = 2`, `uo_out[2:0]` carries `exit_k` — the
checkpoint the decision was taken at (2 or 3 with the default arming), or 0 when the
answer came from the final plane. On easy digits this is 2 rather than 0, and that
difference is the entire point of the design.

### Output views

`DFT_SEL` (uio[6:5]) selects what `uo_out` reports:

| `DFT_SEL` | `uo_out[7:0]` |
|---|---|
| 0 | `{ERR, BUSY, LD_READY, DONE, ANSWER[3:0]}` — the operating view |
| 1 | the config word at the loader's address: the word about to be written mid-load, undefined after a complete load |
| 2 | `{blob_loaded, ld_done, ld_idx[1:0], SCAN_BUSY, exit_k[2:0]}` |
| 3 | the five sticky alarms, individually |

The cocotb tests in `test/` cover reset behaviour, the interlock that ignores `START`
before a blob is loaded, and a full config blob load.

## External hardware

None. The design needs only a host able to drive the 8-bit bus and the control pins — a
microcontroller, an FPGA, or the RP2040 on the Tiny Tapeout demo board. No PMOD, display,
or analog front end is required.

Outputs are plain logic levels, so four LEDs on `uo_out[3:0]` are enough to read the
predicted class directly: the answer is held until the next image. `DONE` on `uo_out[4]`
is a single-cycle pulse, so it needs a latch or a logic analyser rather than an LED.
